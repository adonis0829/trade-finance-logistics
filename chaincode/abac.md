#Testing attribute-based access-control  
  
This is a placeholder for the instructions required to test Hyperledger Fabric attribute-based access control.  In Chapter 4: Designing a Data and Transaction Model with Golang, you will have been introduced to the concept of embedding access control rules within the chaincode.  However to be able to test the rules, additional setup is required.  

This section is meant to be a complement of chapter 4 and will cover:
* Deployment of fabric-ca client  
* Registration and enrollement of an identity with the proper set of attributes  
* Deployment of the chaincode with the access control rules activated
* Testing of the access control rules.

Instructions will be provided shortly, so check back in a few weeks if you happen to be an early reader.
